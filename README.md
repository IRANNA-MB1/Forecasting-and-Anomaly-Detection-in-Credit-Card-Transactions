**<h1>Forecasting and Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions</h1>**  

**This project aims to analyze gain a holistic understanding of credit card transaction activity, and make data-driven decisions to improve your business performance using Power BI.**  

**Data Source**  

The data for this project is sourced from kaggle, which includes information about employees such as City, Date, Card Type, Exp Type, Gender, Amount and more.   

**Kaggle Dataset:**

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  

The following are some of the key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure employee attrition in this Power BI project:  

**Transaction volume:** This KPI measures the number of credit card transactions processed over a certain period of time, such as a day, week, or month. It can help you identify trends and patterns in transaction activity.  
**Forecast accuracy:** This KPI measures how accurately your time series model predicts future transaction volume. You can calculate this by comparing your forecasted values to the actual transaction volume.  
**Anomaly detection rate:** This KPI measures how well your control chart and statistical tests are able to identify anomalies in the data. You can calculate this by comparing the number of anomalies detected to the total number of transactions.  
**False positive rate:** This KPI measures how often your anomaly detection system identifies a transaction as anomalous when it is actually legitimate. You can calculate this by dividing the number of false positives by the total number of transactions.  
**Response time:** This KPI measures how quickly your team responds to anomalies detected in the data. You can calculate this by measuring the time between when an anomaly is detected and when it is resolved.  
**Cost savings:** This KPI measures how much money your credit card company saves by detecting fraudulent activity early. You can calculate this by comparing the cost of fraudulent transactions before and after implementing your anomaly detection system.  

**Analysis and Visualizations**  

**Forecasting of Credit Card Transactions:**  The project analyzes the forecasting of credit card transactions using line chart with 95% Confidence interval to understand credit card transaction activity and make data-driven decisions to improve your business performance.  
**Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions:**  The project analyzes the anomaly detection in credit card transactions using line chart with 90% Sensitivity it helps to identify clusters of anomalous transactions and investigate potential fraudulent activity.  
**Transactions Amount by Year, Exp and Gender:** The project analyzes the transactions amount by year, expenditure and gender by using Box and Whisker chart.  
**Sum of Amount by Gender:** The project analyzes the sum of amount by gender by using stacked bar chart.  
**Sum of Amount by Card Type:** The project analyzes the sum of amount by card type by using donut chart, here we can identify which card type spent more in terms of amount.  
**Sum of Amount by Exp Type:** The project analyzes the sum of amount by expenditure type by using tree chart, here we can identify which expenditure type spent more in terms of amount.  
**Sum of Amount by Card Type and Gender:** The project analyzes the sum of amount by card type and gender by using stacked bar chart, here we can identify which combination of card type and gender spent more in terms of amount.  

**Conclusion**  

By performing time series analysis and creating forecasting models, you can predict future transaction amounts by year and month, and make informed decisions about resource allocation and business strategy.  

By performing anomaly detection, you can identify potential fraudulent activity and improve the accuracy of forecasting models. Using statistical tests and control charts, you can identify outliers in the transaction data, and investigate patterns or trends that may indicate fraudulent activity.  

By combining these different types of analysis and creating a comprehensive dashboard that summarizes the key insights from your analysis, you can gain a holistic understanding of your credit card transaction activity, and make data-driven decisions to improve your business performance.
